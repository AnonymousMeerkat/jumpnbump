little faq for jump n bump on linux

Q: -nosound option doesn't werk?
A: we know, it will be fixed some day... (contributions welcome)

Q: sound effects sound other than on the dos version!
A: i know, the *plop* (if you kill some bunnies) comes too late (lagged)
   and sounds completely wrong too?
   there's sound effects missing if you are near the flies and if
   you jump into the water (the *splash* is missing)
   
Q: i can't download this or that level. you not have enough bandwith?
A: longislandman did a mirror try it from there
   http://jonatkins.org/jumpnbump/levels/
   he has got most of the levels i have (some are missing maybe)

Q: can i do my own level? how?
A: sure.. (oh i will explain some day later how et al..)

Q: do i need click each level one by one to save them? i want all of them?
A: no just go into your jumpnbump directory into data there type
   wget --no-parent -r -l1 http://jumpbump.mine.nu/levels.bz2
   mv jumpbump.mine.nu/*.bz2 .
   rm -rf jumpbump.mine.nu
   bunzip *.bz2
   (oh well i didn't thest it :)

Q: my menuselector looks other than yours?
A: that's probably because i have tkstep8.0 and changed the first
   line in jbrun.tcl to (wish8.0)

Q: i want to do a link to your homepage?
A: find banners here http://jumpbump.mine.nu/jbbanner1.jpg
